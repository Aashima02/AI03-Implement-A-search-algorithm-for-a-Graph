# EXP03-Implement-Depth-First-Search-Traversal-of-a-Graph

#### NAME: Aashima Nazreen Sayeed S
#### REG NO: 212221240002

## AIM:
To ImplementA * Search algorithm for a Graph using Python 3.


## ALGORITHM:

1. Initialize the open list
  
2. Initialize the closed list put the starting node on the open list (you can leave its f at zero)
3. While the open list is not empty
   
   a) find the node with the least f on the open list, call it "q".
   
   b) pop q off the open list
   
   c) generate q's 8 successors and set their parents to q
   
   d) for each successor

   ```
   i) if successor is the goal, stop search

   ii) else, compute both g and h for successor
   successor.g = q.g + distance between 
                      successor and q
   successor.h = distance from goal to 
   successor (This can be done using many 
   ways, we will discuss three heuristics- 
   Manhattan, Diagonal and Euclidean 
   Heuristics)
  
   successor.f = successor.g + successor.h

   iii) if a node with the same position as 
      successor is in the OPEN list which has a 
     lower f than successor, skip this successor
  
   iv) if a node with the same position as 
      successor  is in the CLOSED list which has
      a lower f than successor, skip this successor
      otherwise, add  the node to the open list
      
   ```


   end (for loop)

   e) push q on the closed list end (while loop)
